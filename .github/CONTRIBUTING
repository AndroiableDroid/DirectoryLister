## Pull Requests Requirements

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard.](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)** The easiest
  way to apply the conventions is to install and run
  [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

- **Test all the tings!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document changes in behaviour.** Make sure relevant documentation is kept
  up to date.

- **One feature per pull request.** If you want to do change more than one
  thing, send multiple pull requests.
